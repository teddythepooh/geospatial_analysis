# Geospatial Analysis

As a Project Associate at the Urban Crime Lab, I routinely have to deal with geospatial data in my work. This repo serves a "practice run" for my geospatial work by using *public* data to project different statistics onto a map of Chicago, starting with median-house hold income at the community area level. For this "project," I will compile the following datasets:
1. Chicago community area geometries (Source: Chicago Open Data Portal)
2. Block group level household median income estimates from the 2021 American Community Survey (Source: US Census Bureau API)
3. Block group level population and housing unit estimates from the 2020 Decennial Census (Source: US Census Bureau API)
4. Block group geometries from the 2021 TIGER/line shapefile (Source: for download in the US Census Bureau website)
